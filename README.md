Main FRIDA repository: https://github.com/metno/WorldTransFRIDA 
This repository creates functions to estimate the population-weighted cooling- and heating-degree days for use in FRIDA. It is heavily
based on the data and methods (including scripts) from Werning et al. 2024 Climate Solutions Explorer https://zenodo.org/records/13753537
The scripts should be ran in order, in the scripts/ folder. 
Information on each is given in the code.

Sripts 01-03 require data from Werning et al. 2024 Climate Solutions Explorer https://zenodo.org/records/13753537 - but these steps can be skipped if a user is 
just interested in the steps after this, as the output from script 01-03 is uploaded here.
